            In modern households, especially among busy individuals and families, it is common to 
            have a variety of ingredients in the kitchen but struggle to decide what to cook with them. 
            The problem is exacerbated by the lack of time to plan meals, leading to food waste or 
            unhealthy eating habits. Meal planning apps can significantly alleviate this issue by 
            providing tailored recipe suggestions based on the ingredients you have on hand. They help 
            streamline the planning process, ensuring that meals are both nutritious and varied.
        </p>

            The primary users are busy individuals, students, and families who often find themselves 
            with limited time and resources to plan and prepare meals. These users may lack the 
            culinary creativity or knowledge to make the most of the ingredients they have.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Users experience frustration, food waste, and a reliance on unhealthy or expensive meal 
            options when they cannot decide what to cook with the available ingredients. This impacts 
            their time, budget, and overall well-being. To solve this problem, meal planning can help 
            users create a meal plan with the ingredients they already have. It can also help users keep 
            track of what they have already used and avoid food waste. Finally, meal planning apps can 
            help users find healthy and affordable meal options.

            <ul style="text-align: left;"> - The app will have a set of check boxes that the user will tick based on their available 
                ingredients. The system will then proceed to the recipe generation step.</ul>
            <ul style="text-align: left;"> - The app will suggest recipes that can be made with the entered ingredients, prioritizing 
            those that require the least additional items.</ul>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">- The app will provide nutritional information for each recipe to promote healthy eating.</ul>  
            <ul style="text-align: left;">- Users can filter recipes based on dietary restrictions, cuisine preferences, or time 
            constraints.</ul>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">- If users are missing a few ingredients for a recipe, the app can generate a shopping list of 
            the necessary items.</ul>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">- If users cannot choose what they want to cook, there will be a page where it shows the
            most common household ingredients that can be cooked and made into a meal.</ul>

            The chosen pain point addresses a common challenge in daily life—deciding what to cook 
            with the available ingredients. This problem is particularly relevant in today’s fast-paced 
            environment where people seek convenience and efficiency in their daily routines. By 
            reducing food waste, saving time, and promoting healthier eating, the app will provide 
            significant value to users. It empowers them to make the most of what they have,
